*Need to define conflict, particularly wrt OTs
*typo in fig 1
*if we don’t store the text, do we reconstruct the document every time? what’s up with that? (2.1)
*is there a valid reason for wanting two documents with the same text to hash to a different version?
*diagram of example sync with 3 users
*say that all users start with a blank document (so LCA must exist)
*describe in more detail how to find LCA
*explain that OT contains merge conflict resolution
*design flaw: reconstructing document from OTs can be slow (but only need to do this when you first open it)
*be consistent about saying computer/user/"instance of Collabrador"
